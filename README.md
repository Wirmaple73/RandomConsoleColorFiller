# Random Console Color Filler

R.C.C.F. is a C# Console Application which was written in my free time with the purpose of filling the console screen with (pseudo)randomly-colored squares (two "Full Block" characters).
You may also press any key in the program to re-fill the screen with different colors.

Note: this program is best optimized for .NET Framework 4.5


You're also free to use and modify the program however you wish, enjoy :)
